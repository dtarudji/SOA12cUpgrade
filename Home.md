## Oracle SOA Cloud Service - Migration Lab - OCIclassic to OCI

## Overview

Oracle SOA Cloud Service provides a PaaS computing platform for running Oracle SOA Suite, Oracle Service Bus and orchestrating Integration in the cloud.

Oracle SOAcs provides capabilities in platform as a service.

There are certain pre-requisites that you should be aware of before your side-by-side upgrade in the cloud.

Before migration/side-by-side upgrade, ensure the following:

For SOA and MFT, the source version for side-by-side upgrade in the cloud is 12.1.3 or later.

The approach for migration and the side-by-side upgrade is the same — you’ll provision a new cloud instance of SOA Cloud Service, migrate or recreate configurations from the old source environment and then transition to the newly provisioned cloud instance.

Please review migration details
